-- Nokia UDP SHIM Protocol Wireshark Dissector
-- Version 1.0.1
-- 2021, March
-- Released: 2021-03-24

Assumptions Made

	About SHIM header:

	1) Direction field: 		0 = Ingress and 1 = Egress
	2) Mirror Type field: 		0 = Ethernet and 1 = IP-Only
	3) Filter Action field: 	0 = Drop and 1 = Accept
	4) Interface-Ref-Type field:	0 = If-Index and 1 = sap-instance-id


	About byte order

	1) When doing tests, Big Endian mode was the one whose results made sense.
		For example, Version field is expected to be the same for all packets 
		from a session and should not be equal to 0. The same kind of analisys 
		was valid for Interface field.

Configuration

	At top of our source file there is two variables that can be changed to reflect
	the desired coniguration:

	1) is_litle_endian
		-- Set to false by default to enable Big Endian mode
		local is_litle_endian   = false	

		-- Set to true if you want little endian
		local is_litle_endian   = true
	
	2) shim_port
		-- Port used in pcap files sent. You can set to desired port if necessary
		local shim_port         = 30000

	3) ethernet_dissector_name
		-- Possible Ethernet dissectors: eth_withoutfcs, eth_withfcs or eth_maybefcs
		local ethernet_dissector_name = 'eth_withoutfcs'
